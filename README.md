# Notes Application

This is a simple notes application that allows users to create groups for their notes, add notes to specific groups, and save them in local storage for persistence across page reloads.

## Features

- **Create Groups**: Users can create groups for their notes. A popup will open up to create a new group, and users can choose a color for the group. Clicking outside the popup will close it.

- **Add Notes**: Users can add notes to a particular group. The note creation date and time will be displayed alongside the note.

- **Save Notes**: Users can save the note by clicking on the Send icon in the text input area. If no text is present, the Send icon will be disabled.

- **Local Storage**: All notes and groups are saved in local storage, ensuring persistence across page reloads.

- **Group Switching**: When the user changes the group, all notes related to that particular group will be fetched.

## Usage
